# draft-table

In my high school, students who stuck with drafting classes until AutoCAD got to spend time in a computer room slightly out-of-view of the teacher.
Yes, we played browser games.

### Goals

LM is really good at generating structurally complex intermediate documents.
It is a "typed" assembler with limited capabilities in addressing various decision problems that normally exceed the capabilities of a type system.

*draft-table* will attempt to address problem domains such as:
* generating shader programs
* generating GPU programs
* generating native interfaces for cross-platform deployments
   * Windows / Linux / OSX / WASM / Android / iOS etc.
